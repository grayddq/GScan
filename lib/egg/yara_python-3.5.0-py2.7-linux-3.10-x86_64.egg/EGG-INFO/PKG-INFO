Description: yara-python
        ===========
        
        With this library you can use `YARA <https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara>`_ from
        your Python programs. It covers all YARA's features, from compiling, saving
        and loading rules to scanning files, strings and processes.
        
        Here it goes a little example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            >>> import yara
            >>> rule = yara.compile(source='rule foo: bar {strings: $a = "lmn" condition: $a}')
            >>> matches = rule.match(data='abcdefgjiklmnoprstuvwxyz')
            >>> print(matches)
            [foo]
            >>> print(matches[0].rule)
            foo
            >>> print(matches[0].tags)
            ['bar']
            >>> print(matches[0].strings)
            [(10L, '$a', 'lmn')]
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way of installing YARA is by using ``pip``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          $ pip install yara-python
        
        But you can also get the source from GitHub and compile it yourself:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara-python
          $ cd yara-python
          $ python setup.py build
          $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        Notice the ``--recursive`` option used with ``git``. This is important because
        we need to download the ``yara`` subproject containing the source code for
        ``libyara`` (the core YARA library). It's also important to note that the two
        methods above link ``libyara`` statically into yara-python. If you want to link
        dynamically against a shared ``libyara`` library use:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          $ sudo python setup.py install --dynamic-linking
        
        For this option to work you must build and install
        `YARA <https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara>`_ separately before installing
        ``yara-python``.
